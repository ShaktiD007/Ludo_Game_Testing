Ludo game can play 2 or 4 people together. 
A cardboard or plastic Ludo board and 4 Ludo goti/pieces/tokens are required to play the Ludo game. 
Each person has his own 4 Ludo goti/tokens. 
Boxes are made on the Ludo board, on which Ludo goti/pieces/tokens are carried forward. 
There are four houses in blue, yellow, green and red color on the Ludo board and the Ludo goti / pieces / tokens are also of these four colors. 
In these four houses, Ludo goti/tokens are kept. Ludo dice consists of 1 to 6 digits. 
The number that comes after throwing the dice, the player moves the Ludo goti/pieces/tokens according to that number. 
The person who first arrives at the winning house is the winner. 
It is truly a fun home game, so I like this game the most.
